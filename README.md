# Grayscale image colorization using global,local features and skip connections.

**Abstract:**
In recent years, image colorization has become a hot topic and an interesting research area.Image coloring is utilised in a variety of modern fields like electron microscopy, astronomical photography, cctv recording, restoring historic images and lowering the time spent in drawing cartoons.Due to the huge degree of freedom involved in assigning colour information, this problem is extremely ill-posed. Over the last two decades, a variety of gray scale colorization methods has been introduced, ranging from algorithmically simple, but time and energy-intensive due to human participation to more challenging but automated ones. In this paper a method for automatic colorization of grayscale using local and global image features is proposed.The model’s output is entirely dependent on the images it was trained on, and no human intervention is required.In order to prevent information loss, skip connections are introduced and transfer learning using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model is utilised to extract global features.The results of our method on ImageNet datasets confirm the effectiveness compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives in the field .Finally, the project’s goal is to create realistic and colour accurate images that deceive the viewer.
